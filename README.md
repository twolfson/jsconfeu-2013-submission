The following is my submission for JSConfEU's 2013 Call for speakers.

# Title
The Evolution of Behavioral Driven Development

** The following are paraphrases because I forgot to save it **

# Description
This talk is a review of the history of BDD. Starting with TDD being born, how it entered the mainstream, the evolution into BDD, and the various flavors introduced. Also, this will include my own experimentation to add to the flavor pool.

# Private summary
I have done this presentation at UtahJS and it was well received. This talk came to be from my own experiments in BDD.

I was frustrated with my `describe`s being too far apart and Gherkin being the only specification format out there. I created vows-like frameworks, crossbones and sculptor, that compiled to mocha, runtime and preprocessor respectively. It was my last iteration, doubleshot, that inspired me to research the history of BDD.
